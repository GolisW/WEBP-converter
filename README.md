## General info
This project is designed to conveniently convert .jpg, .jpeg and .png files into .webp files. It allows us to quickly and efficiently convert multiple files in the selected folder and its subfolders at once, if that's what we need.

## Technologies
* C++ 23
* libwebp 1.4.0

## Setup
To run this project you need to:
1. Download the cwebp google library: https://developers.google.com/speed/webp/docs/precompiled
2. Download the converter.exe from my project.
3. Put the converter.exe file into the folder where you want to convert images.
4. Run the converter.exe file.
5. Enter 'c' if you want to convert files only in the current folder or enter 's' if you want to convert also in subfolders.
6. Bravo, you have successfully converted the files. You will find them next to the original files :)

## Sources
This project is inspired by the precompiled cwebp conversion tool from Google.
